Unit 03 Instructions

The goal of this unit is to have the doors open when the cube enters the trigger.

Your trigger script from the previous unit will need to be added to this scene, and will need an additional part. Instead 
of the Debug message, it now needs to set a Scene variable using the "Set Variable" node (make sure you select "Scene" variables
from the dropdown). 

Most of your work in this unit will be fixing the MoveAndThenStop Script Graph. It has been laid out in logical order, 
and you just need to wire it up.
