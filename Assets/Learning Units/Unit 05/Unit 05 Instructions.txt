Unit 05 Instructions

You now have a number of working Script Graphs. From memory, reconstruct the Scene and make it work using your existing Script Graphs.

(Yes, you could cheat and copy the scene from Unit 04, but we're at the point in the semester where you
need to start transitioning to your own intrinsic motivation to learn Unity)
