Unit 04 Instructions

The goal of this unit is to have the doors open when the cube enters the trigger, AND have them close when the cube exits.

You will need to modify your working Script Graphs from Units 02 and 03, adding logic to make it work in reverse. Feel free to 
use the SampleScene as a reference, but note that this Scene (and its Script Graphs) function a little differently, so 
you can't copy the SampleScene verbatim. The best solution will continue to use the two Script Graphs (one for triggering, one 
for moving) and the LERP method.
